      <p>
        I am a mathematician looking for jobs in industry and government. Previously, I was a postdoctoral instructor at Brandeis University and a Boas Assistant Professor at Northwestern University, working in number theory and representation theory.  I am currently interested in more applied disciplines within mathematics and statistics, including cryptography, machine learning, and data science.

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><u>On the global Gross-Prasad conjecture for orthogonal groups</u> (In preparation.)
        <br>
        Building on "A new proof of the Waldspurger formula I," I construct an RTF comparison strategy aimed at the global Gross-Prasad conjecture for orthogonal groups. This essentially reduces the global Gross-Prasad conjecture to local conjectures of "smooth transfer" and "fundamental lemma" type. I verify the fundamental lemma by hand in some low rank examples.</li>
        <li> <a href="research/waldspurgerI.pdf">A new proof of the Waldspurger formula I</a> (<a href="https://msp.org/ant/2019/13-3/p02.xhtml">Algebra and Number Theory, 2019.</a>)
        <br>
        I construct a new comparison between two very different relative trace formulas (RTFs). These RTFs are designed so that their spectral sides "encode" Waldspurger's formula for toric periods; they are also designed keeping the interpretation of Waldspurger's formula as the low rank version of the global Gross-Prasad in mind. I set up an orbit-by-orbit matching, and conjecture and prove statements of "smooth transfer" and "fundamental lemma" type in this setting. This approach should, with further work on regularization of these RTFs, lead to a completely new and independent proof of Waldspurger's formula.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      Here are a few papers that have gotten put on the back burner. I hope to return to them soon.
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li><u>Beyond endoscopy for spherical varieties of rank one: the fundamental lemma</u>, joint with D. Johnstone.  (In preparation.)
        <br>
        We verify the fundamental lemma of Y. Sakellaridis in his "relative beyond endoscopy" program for spherical varieties of rank one.</li>

        <li><u>A new proof of the Waldspurger formula II</u> (In preparation.)
        <br>
        I explain how to regularize the relative trace formulas in "A new proof of the Waldspurger formula I," and deduce a global character identity equivalent to Waldspurger's formula.
